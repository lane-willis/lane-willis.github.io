Welcome to my website! As you can read in the sidebar, my name is Lane Willis. I have been utilizing GitHub to create websites for about 3 months now. I figured I should make my own. I am a new developer and have little experience with coding. I have fumbled my way through Markdown, and have begun to learn some html and css. Yet, I still have little to no experience, and so I have utilized Academic pages as my remote theme. This is a pet project to host material and notes that I might need in the future.

If you have found your way to my site, please feel free to explore. I have my credentials, some book recommendations, and papers I have written, as well as my favorite places of travel.

Blessings and enjoy!
