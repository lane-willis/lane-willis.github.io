## What is the intended end of Christian Theology?
The intended end of Christian theology is spiritual formation. In Christian theology, we are retelling the story of the Gospel of Jesus Christ according to the written text of Scripture in a culturally appropriate way to bring people to a mature relationship with Christ. Christian theology involves the discussion of theological ideas using words, symbols, and actions. Thus, many things that we do at church fall into Christian theology. We portray symbols on the walls and through the ordinances, we sing, preach, and discuss God’s Word, and we take specific actions in our services. In creation we see God create humans for the purpose of relationship and then to grow in maturity in this relationship. God intends for us to grow in our relational knowledge of Him as we participate in communion with Him. This growth comes through spending time with God through His Word and spending time with other believers. God has given us His Word and community to point us back to Him. Specifically, God’s Word reveals the Son and tells us the story of the Gospel. This allows us to see God because those who have seen the Son have seen God. Thus, when we meet the Son, we meet God, and when we place our trust in Him as Savior and Lord, we enter the divine relationship that God originally intended for us. In Matthew 28:18–20 we see how God has given all authority to the Son and with that authority the Son sends believers out to make disciples, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, and Spirit, and teaching them to obey all Jesus has commanded us. Here, we see that part of our purpose as believers is to make disciples and to help lead others to spiritual maturity. We have been commissioned by the Son with lasting words to go and do these things. And in the end, the Son will be with us always through the power of the Holy Spirit. Some might say that the intended end of Christian theology is to find all the right answers to our doctrinal questions. Yet, this end points us to knowledge for intellectual sake, and this knowledge puffs up. This kind of knowledge does not bring us relationally closer to God in and of itself. This kind of knowledge allows pride to creep in, thinking that we know as much as God and that we have figured out all the answers to the questions. At this point, we might not need God anymore. So, we must acknowledge that the intended end of Christian theology isn't intellectual knowledge, but spiritual formation in relationship with Christ. The difference between the two types of knowledge is small, but the result is two different places. In Ephesians 4, we see how God has given us the church united by Christ so seek maturity together. We as believers are meant to live in community and not isolation. Our theology cannot be siloed. Thus, Christian theology must be done in community using words, symbols, and actions. We grow together when we exchange ideas and when we understand how to be precise with the words we use. As we see God working in other’s lives and their spiritual maturity, we can grasp how to seek spiritual maturity ourselves. Walking alongside other believers who display maturity helps us to see what maturity might look like. Yet, none of this can be done without God or His Word. Spiritual maturity and Christian theology must not be separated from the Bible, because without the Bible, we would not be doing Christian theology, we would just be doing theology.
